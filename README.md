<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>Planning a trip with friends can be exciting, but often becomes stressful when trying to match everyone's schedules, preferences, and budgets. To solve this common problem, we developed a smart travel planning website that helps users create personalized trip plans based on their available holidays, travel budget, and group size. This tool aims to make trip planning easier, faster, and more enjoyableâ€”whether you're planning a weekend getaway or a long vacation. Our goal is to simplify group travel by offering suggestions that are affordable, well-timed, and tailored to users' needs.
